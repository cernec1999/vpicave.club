# Who Can Join?

The VPI Cave Club prides itself in not only being a student-run group, but an organization in which any Blacksburg area community members may join. In fact, we have members from all across the world.

# Membership Types

When people first start caving with the club, they are considered prospective members (trainees). In order to become a full member, they must be a student, faculty, or staff member at Virginia Tech and meet certain requirements for membership. Associate membership is extended to those who fulfill the membership requirements but are not affiliated with the university. Full or associate membership is granted when the club feels that the prospective member is responsible underground, can lead trips, and can be trusted with the club’s gear.

# Fees

Dues are ten dollars per semester or twenty dollars per year. We ask that you pay dues once you’ve caved with us a few times and decide to pursue your membership with us. The dues entitle you receive the *Tech Troglodyte New Member Guide* which will start you in the training program. A soft-copy of this can also be located on our website. Paying your fees also allow you to receive the *Tech Troglodyte* semesterly issues (not to be confused with the new member guide).

According to the VPI Cave Club constitution, perspective members are not required to pay dues to use club equipment on a trip. However, as mentioned, we highly encourage the prospective member to pay, after being acquainted, to be in good faith with the club.
